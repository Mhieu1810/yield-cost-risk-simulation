# Yield & Cost Risk Simulation (Monte Carlo)

## Overview
This project simulates manufacturing yield-related costs under uncertainty
using Monte Carlo simulation.

It maps process capability (Cpk) to scrap rate,
evaluates cost variability, and identifies risk drivers.

## Features
- Cp/Cpk → Scrap modeling
- Monte Carlo simulation (1000 runs)
- Histogram cost distribution
- Tornado chart (risk driver analysis)
- Before vs After process improvement comparison

## Engineering Objective
To quantify financial risk due to process variability
and support data-driven improvement decisions.

## How to Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
